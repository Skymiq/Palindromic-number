**Description:**

A palindrome is something that reads the same front and back.
Hypothesis: take any natural number. If it is not a palindrome,
write it backwards and add both numbers. If the result is still not a palindrome,
continue taking as given. Stop on reaching the palindrome or after the 10th try.

For example: 78 + 87 = 165, 165 + 561 = 726, 726 + 627 = 1353, 1353 + 3531 = 4884.

It is a hypothesis testing program for the first 200 natural numbers as starting points.
